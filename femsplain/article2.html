    <p>It took me awhile to decide what I was going to write about for this month&#8217;s &#8220;self improvement&#8221; theme, because virtually every area of my life and personality could use improving: finances, diet, the discipline to actually write that YA novel, the ability to communicate in a sincere manner, etc.</p>
    <p>I settled on my finances because, at the age of 28, it&#8217;s something that weighs upon my mind like a bag of bricks, each labeled with names like &#8220;student loan debt,&#8221; &#8220;credit card debt&#8221; and &#8220;candy bar budget.&#8221; I&#8217;m terrible with money (something <a href="https://femsplain.com/no-use-crying-over-borrowed-money/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve written about on Femsplain</a> before), and as I inch closer to the day my fiscally responsible boyfriend and I move in together, all I can think is, <em>Shit. I don&#8217;t want my money issues to fuck up my relationship.</em></p>
    <p>I know myself, though, and it&#8217;s not enough to simply write about how I&#8217;m going to start budgeting and, like, totally reinvent the way I buy stuff (or rather, don&#8217;t buy stuff). I need motivation, and what better motivation than to say on the Internet -- where nothing you say can <em>ever</em> be taken back -- that I&#8217;m going to essentially keep a spending diary for the month of July?</p>
    <p>Every day, for the next 30 days, I&#8217;ll offer up a small update about how the whole refinancing-my-life-thing is going. Will I resist the temptation to hit up Forever 21 and buy myself that totally necessary T-shirt with the donut print? Will I cave and order a $20 Seamless meal when I could have just walked a block up the street and gotten a 25-cent package of ramen? (I don&#8217;t expect my diet to improve during July.) Will I finally go through all my shit and figure out what&#8217;s worth selling and then use the money I make to make a dent in my debt, or will I finally go through all my shit and figure out what&#8217;s worth selling and then use the money I make to treat myself to an acupuncture session? Only time will tell! Anything could happen! Hold on for dear life!</p>
    <p>Also, feel free to root me on when I save money and chastise me when I fall off the wagon -- I'll need all the help I can get -- and share your own tales of and hopes for self-improvement. Tell us all about the time you reached your ideal BMI, or how you want to start volunteering, or even how you feel like you&#8217;re absolutely perfect just the way you are. We&#8217;ll root you on right back.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
    <p>I did not resist the temptation to order a burger on Seamless (which I still need to Venmo Gabi for lol), and also forgot I&#8217;d made plans to take my roommate out for dinner for her birthday. Add that onto the breakfast, birth control and MetroCard I bought and after just one day I have $63.11 less to show for my efforts. I&#8217;m off to a great start!</p>
    <p class="p1"><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
    <p class="p1">My second day of the financial cleanse went much better. I spent $8.48, on lunch and a box of cat food, then $1.25 on a Capri Sun and a tiny bag of Oreos. (I don&#8217;t really count the $1.25 because I paid with dimes and nickels and that&#8217;s not real money right?) The problem now is feel I should reward myself for spending less than $10 in a day, and I don&#8217;t know how to reward myself without spending money.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
    <p>I lasted until 6 p.m. without spending any money yesterday, thanks to a bag of slightly stale, off-brand cereal I found sitting atop my fridge in the morning. (Score!)</p>
    <p>During a visit to Key Food that evening, my roommate quickly discovered the store was closing for construction and everything was 25%, and all hell broke loose. She ran around with barely contained glee, while I made a beeline for the cheese I&#8217;d originally and wistfully abandoned.</p>
    <p>I tried to make smart purchases that will last at least until next weekend (maybe even beyond!), and think I did okay:</p>
    <p>Chicken breast<br />
    Boxed mashed potatoes<br />
    Sausage links<br />
    Grapes<br />
    Grape tomatoes<br />
    Those tiny mozzarella cheese balls (to eat with the grape tomatoes)<br />
    Goat cheese<br />
    Sliced American cheese (YES I LIKE CHEESE OKAY)<br />
    Sliced turkey and chicken (for sammiches)<br />
    Pudding!<br />
    A 2-liter of Pepsi</p>
    <p>Overall, it came to $28.88. I could&#8217;ve done without the goat cheese, the most extravagant item on, but it&#8217;s goat cheese, and I can put it on the sammiches. The pudding was also unnecessary, but I haven&#8217;t had pudding in like, two years, and I&#8217;m only human.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, so, I went back to Key Foods yesterday. With a cart. And a backpack. Everything was 25% off! Plus there were all these other random sales going on. I can&#8217;t in good conscience pass up buying 20 pouches of Capri Sun for $4 -- that&#8217;s 20 cents a pouch, as opposed to the 50-75 cents I usually spend per pouch at local delis. IT WAS A STEAL.</p>
    <p>I ended up buying about $42 worth of food (which would have been like $66 before all the savings), and got a variety of things that will last awhile, such as:</p>
    <p>Pasta<br />
    Ramen<br />
    Soup<br />
    Raviolis<br />
    Macaroni and cheese<br />
    A giant box of cereal and a giant bag of cereal</p>
    <p>I also went to a BBQ in the afternoon (Happy belated Fourth, btw) and brought this INSANE Entenmann&#8217;s marshmallow cake that ended up being about $6. All in all I spent less than $50 yesterday, which brings the tally up to $149 after&#8230; four days.</p>
    <p>I might need some help.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 5</strong></p>
    <p class="p1">I went to the movies yesterday (using my MoviePass, a Netflix-esque movie subscription, which was technically -- <em>technically </em> -- already paid for in June) and did not buy any of those little corn dog nuggets, even though I really really wanted to. (How strong am I?) Also, my man bought me breakfast, so the only money I spent was $10 on a MetroCard. UP TOP.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 6</strong></p>
    <p>Made my breakfast, made my lunch, made my dinner -- all I bought was a loaf of bread, box of Thin Wheats (which are cheaper than Wheat Thins, heyo) and a large glass bottle from the dollar section of Target (because duh, I can put things in it), all for the low low total of $4.67. I hope you&#8217;re all air high-fiving me.</p>
    <p class="p1"><strong>Day 7</strong></p>
    <p class="p1">I got really excited because I thought I was going to be able to write, "I SPENT $0 YESTERDAY" but then I remembered I had to put money on my MetroCard. Damn this city and its overpriced public transportation. DAMN IT.</p>
    <p><strong>Day 8</strong></p>
    <p>I thought this was finally going to be the day I didn&#8217;t spend any money, simply because I had no money, but then I found $4 in my pants pocket, so I bought some Ho Hos</p>
    <p><strong>Day 9</strong></p>
    <p>Boyfriend bought me dinner last night, so finally -- FINALLY -- I didn&#8217;t spend a cent yesterday.</p>
    <p>However, now is the hard part, because plot twist -- part of the reason I&#8217;ve been able to refrain from buying shit for the past few days (apart from subway rides, because DAMN THIS CITY) is simply because I had like no money.</p>
    <p>But I got paid today, so now I have to resist buying useless crap not because I literally can&#8217;t, but because it&#8217;s useless crap. *prayer hands emoji*</p>
    <p><strong>Days 10, 11 and 12</strong></p>
    <p>Just got back from my WEEKEND SPENDING BENDER. Jk, I was in Pennsylvania for my boyfriend&#8217;s family reunion, and because it was Pennsylvania, there wasn&#8217;t too much for me to spend money on.</p>
    <p>On Friday my bank account took a pretty big hit, BUT it was a responsible hit, because I paid a bunch of bills and refilled my MetroCard (AGAIN).</p>
    <p>As for things I didn&#8217;t need to spend money on? The total came to about $55, mainly because virtually all my food and train tickets were taken care of.</p>
    <p>Later today I&#8217;m going to talk to Katie Krumpter, a financial advisor and occasional Femsplain contributor, to see if she has some tips for how to keep my spending down. *fingers crossed*</p>
    <p><strong>Days 13, 14 and 15</strong></p>
    <p>Man it&#8217;s hard to update something every day (apart from Twitter obvs). I&#8217;ve still been doing okay money-wise, though on Tuesday I did spend an alarming $16 for an umbrella so I wouldn&#8217;t get caught in the sudden rainstorm that ended approximately three seconds before I went back outside.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m currently on a mini-vacation in Illinois (I&#8217;ll be in Chicago starting Friday) and while I haven&#8217;t spent any money while actually in Illinois, I spent like $25 just at the airport, because it&#8217;s the airport and everything&#8217;s movie theater expensive.</p>
    <p>At the suggestion of financial advisor and occasional Femsplain contributor Katie Krumpter, I signed up for Mint. (Or rather, I re-signed up for Mint, since I used it once before but got too lazy to bother with it. Sensing a theme&#8230;?)</p>
    <p>Mint is fun, because, at a glance, I can see how often I ordered and how much I spent on Seamless in a given month. For example, in May, I ordered Seamless 19 -- NINETEEN -- times, sometimes twice in one day, because I&#8217;m a monster.</p>
    <p>Katie and I also discussed my complete lack of impulse control, and while she kindly told me not to beat myself up too much, I&#8217;m pretty sure I actually need to beat myself up when it comes to money, because part of the reason I&#8217;m not careful with it is my tendency to rationalize buying things no one needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Days 16-26</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah so keeping a diary is hard. Kudos to anyone who actually manages to write in a diary or journal every day.</p>
    <p>Anyway&#8230; Chicago kind of tapped me out, because there&#8217;s a lot of food there and I like to eat. Also, there was this bar with these shots that taste like oatmeal cookies and, well, you know how it goes.</p>
    <p>Also, the end of the month is generally when my bills are due, and there was an issue with a loan from my grandparents. Specifically, I kind of put off paying them back in a timely fashion and they&#8217;ve finally come to collect and, in the interest of transparency, I had to ask for an advance on my next paycheck at one of my freelancing gigs. (There were tears, as per usual.)</p>
    <p>Since being back in New York I&#8217;ve been able to pretty much avoid spending money (except on MetroCard fares, because DAMN THE MTA), but I still have about five days to do something stupid financially, so stay tuned.</p>
