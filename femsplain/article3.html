  <h3>KEEP ON FRENCHIN' ON</h3>

    <p>Hey there! I am Blaire "4ever" Warren, a licensed cosmetologist of six years, and one of my greatest joys in life is encouraging women to be strong, bold, sexy and not afraid to own it and, most importantly, confident. I owned my first salon at age 23 and it failed, but I learned a lot about myself because of it. For instance, I know that I cannot have a partner. I know that I am ambitious. I know that I WILL be a successful entrepreneur because I've earned some valuable gems. Mostly, though, I know I'm not afraid of taking risks. </p>

    <p>And so, armed with more than eight years in the fashion industry, I am so happy to share my wealth of knowledge of beauty with Femsplain in an all-new monthly column, and even more so, I'm honored to have the trust of my craft. </p>

    <p>As my first piece... </p>

    <p>I want to talk about the effects of white beauty lies and what they can do to our friendships. We all have friends who make different hair and makeup choices. The one friend who needs to retire the black lip liner with every shade of lipstick. The one who may have a relaxer, which is a hair-straightening chemical, and is going through the relaxer-to-natural transition phase. The one friend who may use an obscene amount of black eyebrow filler... I mean, obscene. One can be, like myself, addicted to versatility, or what I like to call hair help, "weaves and wigs." </p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there is always one friend who may do a little bit too much, and you being the good friend that you are, what do you do? Do you compliment a haircut that isn't flattering? Do you praise an un-praiseworthy weave? Do you celebrate a blush gone rogue? Or, are you the honest friend that realizes there are some consequences that may come with truth? </p>

    <p>I am, lovingly, the honest friend. I can't allow you to sport -- or at least not be aware of -- the not-so-flattering changes you've made. I can't help but want to show you the best way for you to try that trendy look in a way that's right for you. Just yesterday, I had a chat with my sister, who normally slays her makeup, about her overuse of a powder, and how it was too cool-toned for her warm skin. It looked horrible, like a muddy grey, and I couldn't let her leave with the two-shades-too-light powder. At first, she looked at me with emoji-like eyes of "excuse you, bitch!?" but after explaining to her that it was wrong for her skin temperature, she assured me that it was a powder she just put on. I told her to ix-nay the powder and try a more natural beat, and that if she wants to continue to use it, to go with a warmer toned powder. I can't white lie, I just can't do it. My training will not allow me to. Well that, and my obvious Virgo bluntness. But I mean it all with love and I always find the proper solutions! </p>

    <p>So now, I pass the pen and ask you... What kind of friend are you? Do you let the white lie fly? Or do you swallow the chunk in your throat and keep it real, aware of the consequences? </p>
