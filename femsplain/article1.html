    <p>Bonjour, Sami!
    <p>It is I, your French-English dictionary. Remember me? I didn't think so.</p>
    <p>By <i>maintenant</i>, you and I have known each other for many years. I think we first met in the middle of your <i>universite</i> experience. Summertime was a time of boredom for you, I understand. You kept saying that Paris was the first place outside of the United States that you wanted to visit, and you swore you were actually going to teach yourself French. Despite taking Spanish in high school, in a class led by a qualified instructor, you truly believe that if you applied yourself, you'd be able to learn a whole new language.</p>
    <p><i>Au contraire, mon cheri</i>. Here I sit most days, generally unused and rarely opened. I'm in one of your desk drawers -- <i>loin des yeux, loin du coeur</i>. You aren't a consistent friend at all. Though you pride yourself on your routine and healthy habits, sticking with me hasn't been one of them over the years.</p>
    <p>Every year, though, around the bright days of <i>juin</i> and <i>juillet</i>, you find yourself flailing, afraid of falling into a mental rut. Something still reminds you of those times between college semesters when you wanted to still be learning, even though you were on vacation. Admirable, sure, but it's been so long that no one can congratulate you on this small feat.</p>
    <p>And yet, you keep at it. And perhaps that is commendable on some level. It is nothing to be admired, but your persistence is quite <i>joli</i>. It's cute that you keep coming back to me, and the other workbooks, and even the newfangled apps, in hopes of sharpening your skills out of obscurity.</p>
    <p>Good for you, <i>je suppose</i>. It shows you still have hope, both for yourself and probably also for humanity. It means there's always something you can rely on, since you'll almost definitely never actually complete this task. It's one of the constants in your life, this never-ending cycle. It's like a hobby some people try -- like a <i>tricotage</i> scarf, or trying <i>courir</i> in your neighborhood -- in order to better their lives, but this learning process seems to be only for selfish purposes.</p>
    <p>Though we haven't seen each other too often, I can tell you're not the selfish type. Perhaps it's tied to your dream of travel. Perhaps because it's one of the languages of <i>amor</i>. Regardless, it's a quest you've given to yourself to complete.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should admire your <i>patience</i>, <i>mon petit cheri</i>. It takes a lot of courage to keep trying something, even if it doesn't seem to be sticking or working. Good for you! You keep trying! You haven't given up after all this time, and there's something to say for that. It's adorable, even. Precious. It's been so many years, and yet here we still are.</p>
    <p>I've grown to love this drawer. It's my <i>maison</i>. I sit next to blank notebooks, for that novel you've always meant to write. I'm near charging cords and Thank You notes you still have leftover from your college graduation. We're just little remnants of times gone by, here for you when you decide it's time. That's our job. And, at least in my case, I do feel useful at times.</p>
    <p>We all believe we'll get properly used eventually. We do have <i>confiance</i> in you, silly girl. Since you've kept coming back, it shows that this project means more to you than just some passing whim.</p>
    <p>Remember when you bought those athletic shoes your freshman year of college? You saw everyone else on campus running all the time, and you thought you'd at least become a power walker or something. Those now exist at the bottom of one of your shoe buckets. At least I'm not there.</p>
    <p>And remember when you thought you wanted to draw, so you got a how-to-draw book and then you <i>pleure</i> real big tears when your giraffe came out looking all dumb? You gave that up real quick and never looked back.</p>
    <p>And the time when you were five, when you were being taught how to ride a bike? You fell off and scraped your <i>genou</i>. You swore right then to never get back on, and you never did.</p>
    <p>But who needs jogging and drawing and bikes when you have a slightly lonely French <i>dictionnaire</i> who will always be there for you, when you decide it's time to pick up your studies again?</p>
    <p>So keep it up, <i>champignon</i>. Er, I mean, <i>champion</i>. Keep watching Amelie and Paris, je t'aime and overly romanticizing them in your mind. Keep dreaming about, perhaps, one day traveling to France (or even just Europe). Because without those little hopes floating around your head, we might meet even less frequently than we do now.</p>
    <p>Until next time, or probably next <i>ete</i>, as it were.</p>
